# DNS for the app URLs students hit in their browser, e.g.
# ecommerce.<dns_zone_name>. Records alias the shared ALB by name (not IP),
# so they stay correct even if the ALB's underlying IP rotates -- no runtime
# resolution needed anywhere else in the lab.
#
# Each app claims a root-level subdomain of dns_zone_name directly (no
# namespace prefix) -- only point this at a domain where those five names
# (ecommerce, banking, food-delivery, student-portal, support-tickets)
# aren't needed for anything else.
#
# The ALB doesn't exist until the AWS Load Balancer Controller creates it
# from the Ingress resources (scripts/setup.sh step 8, well after this
# directory's first `terraform apply` in step 1), so the aws_lb lookup below
# is gated behind create_dns_records: false on the first apply (before the
# ALB exists), then scripts/setup.sh re-applies with it set true once the
# ALB is confirmed up.
