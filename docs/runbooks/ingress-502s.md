# Runbook: Ingress 502s / 503s

## Symptoms

- Browsing to `http://<app>.$(cat .lab-domain)` returns a gateway error from the
  ALB instead of the app itself. In this lab, a target group with **zero
  healthy targets** (confirmed by testing) makes the ALB return `503
  Service Temporarily Unavailable`; a `502 Bad Gateway` specifically means
  the ALB found a registered target but the connection to it was refused
  or reset mid-request (e.g. the pod crashed between being registered
  healthy and the request arriving). Both point to the same place to
  look.
- Since every app's Ingress uses `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:
  ip`, the ALB targets pod IPs directly (the AWS Load Balancer Controller
  watches each Service's endpoints to keep the target group in sync) --
  this is an ALB target-group -> pod problem, not an application-code
  problem -- the app never got the request.

## Diagnostic commands

```bash
# Does the Service have any healthy endpoints at all?
kubectl -n <namespace> get endpoints <app>-frontend

# If empty, the Service has no ready pods to send traffic to -- check why
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
kubectl -n <namespace> describe pod <pod>

# Check the AWS Load Balancer Controller's own logs for the specific error
kubectl -n kube-system logs deployment/aws-load-balancer-controller --tail=100 | grep <app>

# Confirm the Ingress resource itself is pointing at the right Service/port
kubectl -n <namespace> get ingress <app> -o yaml
```

## Common root causes in this lab

- **Zero ready replicas** -- the most common cause. If every pod behind
  `<app>-frontend` is failing its readiness probe (or was just scaled to
  0), the target group has no healthy targets and the ALB returns 503
  immediately.
- **Wrong port** in the Ingress or Service (`targetPort` not matching the
  container's actual listening port -- frontends in this lab listen on
  `8080`, backends on `4000`).
- **AWS Load Balancer Controller itself down or mid-restart** -- rare,
  but check `kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-load-balancer-controller`
  if *every* app 502s simultaneously -- since all 5 apps share one ALB,
  a controller outage (or an ALB/target-group misconfiguration) can take
  all of them down at once, unlike a per-app ALB.

## Fix

1. If the Service has zero endpoints because pods aren't ready, that's
   really a different runbook depending on *why* they're not ready --
   check `pod-crash-loop.md` or `db-connection-exhaustion.md` for the
   pod-level root cause.
2. If replicas were scaled to 0 (deliberately or by accident):
   ```bash
   kubectl -n <namespace> scale deployment/<app>-frontend --replicas=2
   ```
3. If the Ingress/Service port mapping is wrong, fix
   `apps/<app>/k8s/service-frontend.yaml` or
   `ingress/<app>-ingress.yaml` and reapply.

## Prevention

- Keep `minReplicas` on the HPA at 2 (already the default in this lab's
  `hpa-backend.yaml` pattern) so a single pod failure never drops a
  Service to zero endpoints.
- Alert on Service endpoint count, not just pod status, since "pods exist"
  and "pods are routable" are different facts.

## Reproduce this in the lab

```bash
scripts/chaos/scale-to-zero.sh <namespace> <app>-frontend
curl -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://<app>.$(cat .lab-domain)/    # 503
kubectl -n <namespace> scale deployment/<app>-frontend --replicas=2
```
